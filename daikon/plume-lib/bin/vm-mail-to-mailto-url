# Using the Mozex extension for Firefox, set the mailer to:
#   vm-mail-to-mailto-url %r

# This script is necessary because if you tried to use emacsclient (with
# arguments) as the mailer, then mozex would send three arguments:
#   "-e", "(vm-mail-to-mailto-url", and the URL followed by close parenthesis.

exec emacsclient -e "(vm-mail-to-mailto-url \"$1\")"
